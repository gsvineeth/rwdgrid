rwdgrid is a grid system based on the popular [960 grid system](http://960.gs/), which is responsive and ranges from mobile, tablet, laptop and
wide screen displays.

Naming convention is very similar to the 960 grid system, where underscore is replaced by hyphen to increase readabilty.

rwdgrid has different grid systems for the following breakpoints:

- 1200px+
- 1024px+
- 720px+
- and mobile

This can be used as a base grid system that will help you to build responsive web sites with your existing proficiency over other, more popular, grid systems.

Sincere thanks to [960.gs](http://960.gs), HTML5 Shiv, CSS3 MediaQueries.js (IE polyfill for media queries - don't forget the existing web!), HTML5Boilerplate and you! :)

rwdgrid is free to use and abuse under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
